# `makemehapi` Exercises

These are my solutions to the makemehapi tutorial found at https://github.com/hapijs/makemehapi

First, download the dependencies by running: 

```
npm i 
```

You'll also need to install the cli for `makemehapi`, globally: 

```
npm install -g makemehapi
```

Then, run `makemehapi` to read the instructions for each exercise.  When you are ready, hook up verification by running `makemehapi verify {exercise}.js`.

I will eventually re-order them by prefixing the exercise number.
